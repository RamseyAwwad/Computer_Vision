BOW ratio: 1.213425
texture concat ratio: 0.700000
texture mean ratio: 0.419761

Within-class distance should be smaller than the between-class distance because the code can tell when two same-class images are the same.

Texture mean ratio has the smallest within-class distance.

I excepted bag of words to be lower. Not sure why it is that high.

Again, I expected bag of words to be lower because I assumed that the two image classes would have similar word distributions.

Texture mean ratio is very low so I would say that is the best descriptor here.
